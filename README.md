# Handover Pack Builder

This is a python script which automates the generation of client handover packs for Trealdighter Ltd (solar PV installers).
This process involves:
  * fetching the correct MS Word template files
  * merging some of these with an MS Excel spreadsheet
  * converting the resulting files to pdf
  * merging these into one final pdf document

This is my first python project.

## Prerequisites

To use this utility (likely only useful if you work for Treadlighter Ltd.), please make sure you:
  * have installed the latest version of python 3
  * are working on Windows
  * have read the ```instructions.txt``` file in this repo
  
## To Use

To use, simply run the script (```python3 merge.py```) and follow the instructions.
